MDP-PHP-DEVELOPMENT-ENVIRONMENT
================

This is a set of submodules that I deploy to a Openshift PHP stack, this is how I run my php test apps

---

OpenShift is Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) it allows you to quickly setup and host applications in their cloud environment (at a test scale... for free). It allows for own domain, multiple gears that run a number of different technologies (php, node, python to name a few).

It deploys entirely using git which makes tracking pretty streamlined if you use git regularly.

Bit of a steep initial learning curve but a nice way to run small hobby apps if you are willing to do the initial work to learn how it all works.

Ok that was my openshift plug, heres the website: https://www.openshift.com/
